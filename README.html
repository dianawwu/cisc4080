        <h3>Homework 6 (check back for updates)</h3>
        <h4>Due Wednesday, November 22</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>The following files contain an implementation, and some testing
                code, of a binary heap for use as a min-priority queue. You
                must complete the implementation of the class in the header
                file (<code>bin_heap.h</code>), which you will use in follow-up
                questions. If you compile the <code>bin_heap.cpp</code> file
                run the resulting executable, it will allow you to test the
                heap by manually entering new elements (as value and key pairs)
                and observing the resulting heap as it repeatedly pops its min-
                key values.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="hw6/bin_heap.h"><code>bin_heap.h</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="hw6/bin_heap.cpp"><code>bin_heap.cpp</code></a></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>The following files contain C++ code and a text file with
                interstate highway route distances between cities across the
                United States. Use the priority queue (heap) you built in
                the previous part to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding
                the shortest routes between cities.<br><br>

                The <code>Graph</code> class defined in <code>graph.h</code> is
                very similar to that found in HW5, but slightly modified to
                incorporate edges with non-integer lengths. You should not need
                to modify it. Your task is to complete the implementations of
                the <code>Dijkstra()</code> and <code>get_path()</code>
                functions in <code>routes.cpp</code> to obtain the path distances
                sought in the <code>test_shortest_paths()</code> function that 
                runs when the compiled code is executed from the command line.
                <br><br>

                The <code>test_shortest_paths()</code> function should print
                paths and path distances between:
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>New York to Los Angeles</li>
                    <li>New York to Miami</li>
                    <li>New York to Seattle</li>
                    <li>New York to San Francisco</li>
                    <li>New York to Bostong</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                As in any problem you are trying to solve, it may help in your
                code development to create a smaller graph for testing purposes.
                Feel free to do that in this case on your own, creating a smaller
                city graph file from the one provided and having the program use
                your modified version until you have your program working.<br>

            <li><strong>DESCRIPTION AND FILES TO BE UPDATED...</strong><br>
                Once again use your binary heap min-prority queue, this to
                compress the image displayed below. The left image uses 8-bit
                grayscale (i.e., 256 luminance levels) and is 429x600 pixels.
                The right image has the same dimensions, but uses only 4 bits
                per pixel. However, it can be further compressed by using
                Huffman encoding.

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th width=50%><img src="hw6/kayak_gray.png"/></th>
                        <th width=50%><img src="hw6/kayak_reduced.png"/></th>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <br>Complete/answer the following tasks/questions:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Complete the code in <code>huffman.cpp</code> to
                        reduce/compress the image data. This file uses classes and
                        functions defined in <code>huffman.h</code> and
                        <code>image.h</code>, which you probably want to look at for
                        reference, but should not need to modify. Download the code
                        and image files below. Note that the image file is not
                        actually encoded in a standard image file format, it is
                        instead a text file containing a 429x600 matrix of pixel
                        brightnesses (grayscale levels) for you to work with in C++
                        without having to install additional tools on your computer.
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Why is does the compression factor typically improve as
                        the number of grayscale levels are reduced? But why is
                        it worse for 8 levels compared to 9 levels?
